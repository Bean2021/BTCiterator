# BTCiterator
## Introduction
 This code can iterate the blocks over bitcoin. I use it to find how many bocks were mined more than 2 hours. It will take several minutes.
## Usage
cargo build
target/debug/bitcoin-timestamp --url 'http://localhost:8332' --user 'YOUR USERNAME OF BTC NODE' --pass 'YOUR PASSWORD OF BTC NODE'
